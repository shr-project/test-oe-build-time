You had no conf/local.conf file. This configuration file has therefore been
created for you from /OE/build/test-oe-build-time/poky/meta-poky/conf/templates/default/local.conf.sample
You may wish to edit it to, for example, select a different MACHINE (target
hardware).

You had no conf/bblayers.conf file. This configuration file has therefore been

To add additional metadata layers into your configuration please add entries
to conf/bblayers.conf.
