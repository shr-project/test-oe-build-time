You had no conf/local.conf file. This configuration file has therefore been
created for you from /OE/build/test-oe-build-time/poky/meta-poky/conf/local.conf.sample
You may wish to edit it to, for example, select a different MACHINE (target
hardware). See conf/local.conf for more information as common configuration
options are commented.

You had no conf/bblayers.conf file. This configuration file has therefore been
created for you from /OE/build/test-oe-build-time/poky/meta-poky/conf/bblayers.conf.sample
To add additional metadata layers into your configuration please add entries
to conf/bblayers.conf.

### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-full-cmdline
    core-image-sato
    core-image-weston
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'

Other commonly useful commands are:
 - 'devtool' and 'recipetool' handle common recipe tasks
 - 'bitbake-layers' handles common layer tasks
 - 'oe-pkgdata-util' handles common target package tasks
